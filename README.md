# ORCA-FI-Use-Cases
Use cases for Cloud Federation Reference Architecture-based federations, including stakeholders, deployment, governance, and associated management tasks.

The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published the CFRA, SP 500-332, in February 2020. The IEEE P2302 WG is currently working on federation-specific standards in support of the CFRA. This will complement existing standards that are directly relevant to managing federations.
The specific scope of the ORCA-CFRA-Outreach WG will be to develop and socialize use cases across academia, industry and government. A key part of these use cases will be to identify the deployment and governance models that are most appropriate. This collection of use cases will also be used to identify the implementation approach(es) that will be practical and appealing to the widest segment of stakeholders.

Exit Strategy:
The work of this group will be deemed complete with the finalization of the documents.
